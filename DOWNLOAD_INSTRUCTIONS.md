# Download Files for Your Server

## ðŸŽ¯ Simple Solution
I'll create a deployment package with all the files you need. You can download them and copy to your server.

## ðŸ“¦ Files You Need to Download:
1. **pd13eventcal.html** - Complete calendar application (2,544 lines)
2. **Lisa-Circular-PD-Logo-1-MIN.png** - PD13 logo file
3. **server.js** - Updated production server (already on your server, but backup)

## ðŸ“‹ Download Steps:

### Step 1: Download the Files
I'll provide you with direct links or file content for:
- The complete HTML file
- The logo image file

### Step 2: Copy to Your Server
```cmd
# Copy the downloaded files to:
C:\pd13eventcal\src\pd13eventcal.html
C:\pd13eventcal\src\Lisa-Circular-PD-Logo-1-MIN.png
```

### Step 3: Test Your Calendar

http://10.172.1.200:3000
```

## ðŸ”— File Access Options:
