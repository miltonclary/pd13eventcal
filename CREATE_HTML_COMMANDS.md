## üìù Ready for HTML Content?
The HTML file is 2,544 lines. I can:

**Option A**: Give you the complete content in one big block to copy/paste
**Option B**: Break it into smaller chunks (5-6 parts) that are easier to handle

Which would you prefer? Then I'll provide the exact content to paste into Notepad.
