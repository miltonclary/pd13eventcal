# Correct Architecture Plan

## üéØ You're Right - Let's Clarify the Setup

### Current Architecture (What We Should Have):
- **Webserver (10.172.1.63)**: Only Node.js runtime + minimal server code
- **PDShare (W:\Ecal)**: All application files (HTML, images, data)
- **Users**: Access calendar through webserver, but files served from network share

### What We've Been Doing Wrong:
‚ùå Trying to copy all files to the webserver
‚ùå Making webserver store everything locally

### What We Should Do:
‚úÖ **Webserver**: Just Node.js + server.js that points to network share
‚úÖ **PDShare**: Keep all files in W:\Ecal
‚úÖ **Server.js**: Configure to serve files from W:\Ecal instead of local src/

## üîß Correct Plan:

### Option A: Server Points to Network Share
```javascript
// In server.js, change:
app.use(express.static('src')); 
// To:
app.use(express.static('W:\\Ecal')); 
```

### Option B: Run Everything from PDShare
- Keep Node.js on webserver
- Run the calendar application directly from W:\Ecal
- Point users to the network share location

## ‚ùì Question:
Which approach matches your original PDSQL1 setup?
1. Webserver serves files from network share?
2. Or users access files directly from network share?
